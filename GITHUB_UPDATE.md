Here’s a clean step-by-step for pushing your local changes up to your GitHub repo (`zmongo_retriever`):

---

### 1. Check your current branch

```bash
git status
```

* This shows which branch you’re on (usually `main` or `master`).
* It also lists files you’ve changed.

---

### 2. Add your changes

```bash
git add .
```

This stages **all modified/new files**.
(Use `git add <filename>` if you want to add only specific files.)

---

### 3. Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Update to sync with zai-core/zgemini"
```

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Update Tests"
```

---

### 4. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin master
```

* Replace `main` with whatever branch you’re on (check step 1).
* If your repo is new or you haven’t pulled in a while, you may need to run:

  ```bash
  git pull origin main --rebase
  git push origin main
  ```

---

### 5. Verify on GitHub

Go to [your repo](https://github.com/CentralFloridaAttorney/zmongo_retriever) — you should see your commits reflected.

⚡️ Tip:
If you’re collaborating and want to keep `main` clean, make a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-init
git add .
git commit -m "Add __init__.py for zmongo_toolbag"
git push origin feature/add-init
```
