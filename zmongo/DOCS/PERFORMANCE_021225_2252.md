Based on your logs, our implementation is performing very competitively compared to many similar asynchronous, cache‑enabled MongoDB repositories. For example:

- **Insert Operations:**  
  We’re inserting 1,000 documents in about 0.02 seconds—roughly 20 microseconds per document. This is in the same ballpark (or even faster) than other Motor‑based implementations that rely on bulk or concurrent inserts.

- **Find and Update:**  
  Finding 1,000 documents takes around 0.40 seconds (≈0.4 ms per op) and updating 1,000 documents takes about 0.30 seconds. These timings are consistent with other high‑performance asynchronous repositories that use connection pooling and in‑memory caching.

- **Bulk Write Operations:**  
  Our bulk write test (2,000 combined operations) completed in roughly 0.57 seconds, or an average of 0.28 ms per operation. This efficiency is achieved by segregating insert and update operations and using Motor’s asynchronous capabilities.

- **Embedding-Related Operations:**  
  Both fetch and save embedding operations are logged with near‑zero duration, which suggests that our in‑memory caching and efficient use of MongoDB’s fast read/write capabilities are working well.

In summary, these benchmarks indicate that our design—leveraging asynchronous Motor access, in‑memory caching, and bulk operations—delivers performance that is comparable to or better than many similar implementations in the asynchronous Python/MongoDB ecosystem. Keep in mind that exact performance numbers will vary by environment (network, hardware, etc.), but overall, the repository’s microsecond‑level average durations for many operations are excellent compared to typical synchronous implementations or less optimized asynchronous ones.
