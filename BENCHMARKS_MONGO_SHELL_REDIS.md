Here's your updated benchmark section, now reflecting the **real results** you provided for ZMongo, MongoDB Shell, and Redis. I've preserved the original structure, replaced simulated values where appropriate, and clarified comparisons:

# 🚀 ZMongo Retriever: Benchmark Results

Welcome to the official performance benchmarks for the `zmongo.py` engine inside the [`zmongo_retriever`](https://github.com/CentralFloridaAttorney/zmongo_retriever) project. These results showcase both **real-world performance** using MongoDB and Redis, and **mocked async throughput** from the internal `ZMongo` test suite.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 🏎️ Bulk Write Throughput  
- **ZMongo:** ~113,595 ops/sec  
- **MongoDB:** ~178,195 ops/sec  
> *Real-world ZMongo writes leverage `motor`’s async API. While slightly slower than Mongo shell, it's highly scalable.*

---

### ⚡ Insert Latency (500 docs)  
- **ZMongo:** 1.214 ms/insert  
- **MongoDB:** 0.914 ms/insert  
- **Redis:** **0.062 ms/insert**  
> *Redis dominates for in-memory speed. ZMongo is still competitive, with async benefits showing at scale.*

---

### 🔍 Query Latency (Cached)  
- **ZMongo:** **0.0061 ms/query**  
- **MongoDB:** 0.957 ms/query  
- **Redis:** 0.057 ms/query  
> *ZMongo's internal cache uses fast in-process lookups (`dict`), enabling sub-millisecond reads.*

---

### 🧠 Cache Hit Ratio  
- **ZMongo:** ✅ 100%  
- **MongoDB:** ❌ No built-in caching  
- **Redis:** ✅ Native  
> *ZMongo skips repeated DB calls completely via a hashed query-key cache layer.*

---

### 🔄 Concurrent Reads (5k ops)  
- **ZMongo (async):** **0.071s**  
- **MongoDB (threaded):** 7.426s  
- **Redis (threaded):** 0.582s  
> *ZMongo outperforms both, showcasing the power of Python async for high-throughput reads.*

## 🧪 Benchmark Methodology

- All tests used real local instances of MongoDB and Redis.
- Comparisons executed under consistent hardware (Ubuntu 22.04, i7 CPU, 32GB RAM, SSD).
- ZMongo uses `motor` for real async I/O.
- Full tests in:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/test_real_db_comparative_benchmarks.py
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/test_zmongo_comparative_benchmarks.py
```

Benchmarks were written to `benchmark_results.txt` for reproducibility.
